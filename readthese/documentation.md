# Documentation

> Classes and methods must be well-documented in order to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings

## Docstrings for Classes

> - Every class's constructor should have a descriptive docstring
> - Every expected variable's function should be explained
> - The specific task the class is taking care of must be explained
> - The results of the taskss the class needs to perform should be described

## Docstrings for Methods

> - Complex, long methods should also have docstrings
> - The method's internal workings and expected values should be explained
> - Return values should be mentioned too

## Descriptive Comments on Variables

> - Variable names should be descriptive by themselves
> - Short, single line comments can be used above variables

**Prefer longer names over short, non-descriptive and hard to understand variable names**
